- Go to your PDI -> Service Portal Home -> Request Something -> Can we Help you? -> Create incident
1.
- Create a new variable on the form called "Company Name" of type single line text
- The team leader said he wants to see this variable on the form only if the urgency is marked as 1 - high, so only the most urgent incidents will provide a user's company name.

2.
- The team leader says that whenever the urgency variable changes, he wants the "Please describe your issue below" variable's value cleared.

3.
- Finally, he wants you to allow the submission of the form only IF the user's first name who is submitting the form is not "Andrew".

Once you are done, check everything is working properly - this means:
- Make sure the company name is visible only if 1 - high is chosen.
- Make sure the  issue description clears every time the urgency variable changes.
- Impersonate "Andrew Och" and make sure he cannot submit the create incident form.
