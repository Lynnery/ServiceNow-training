Create a scripted rest API which returns an array of JSONs.
each JSON contains a label, name and children [] - the JSON represents a knowledge category.
The idea is to present an hierarchical view of the knowledge categories in the system (and later use it for frontend display).
Remember that each knowledge category may have an infinite number of children nodes (and so do their children).
