- Read about the Service Portal
- Read about Pages, Widgets, Client Scripting, Server Side Scripting, HTML, Link Function and CSS
on The Service Portal.
Exercise:
Create a new endpoint on the service portal which allows adding users to an inputed group just like in the CTS (without the groups' UI - just group input).
Since this task is not easy, you'll be instructed:
- UI is your responsibility, just make sure the user can select a group and has the option to add a user to it
Steps:
- Create a Service Portal Page
- Create a widget inside this page
- HTML should include the groups' selector and user selector
- Server Scripting should call a script include which is responsible for adding users using sys_user_gr_member
- Client scripting will formalize the input
- CSS will be defined however you'd like it to be.
Bonus:
Read about Link function and Angular Dependencies
